# fire_detection
This is my AP Research project using Keras and TensorFlow for fire and smoke detection in images, coded in Google Colabratory.

## Datasets
The two datasets were curated from various sources, including readers Gautam Kumar and David Bonn from PyImageSearch. The fire dataset and non-fire datasets are located in seperate directories within the same folder.

### Fire Dataset
The fire dataset includes various images of forest fires in nature.

### Non-Fire Dataset
The non-fire dataset includes various photographs of nature, as well as various images including colors typically found in fires such as red or orange.

## Project Structure
The Jupyter Notebook accesses a folder named content, which is the root directory in Google Colabratory. The fire and non-fire datasets are located in folders named Fire Dataset and Non-Fire Dataset, respectively.
