# fire_detection
This is my AP Research project using Keras and TensorFlow for fire and smoke detection in images, coded in Google Colabratory.

## Datasets
The two datasets were curated from various sources, including readers Gautam Kumar and David Bonn from PyImageSearch. The fire dataset and non-fire datasets are located in seperate directories within the same folder.

### Fire Dataset
