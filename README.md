# fire_detection
This is my AP Research project using Keras and TensorFlow for fire and smoke detection in images, coded in Google Colabratory.

## Datasets
The two datasets were curated from various sources, including readers Gautam Kumar and David Bonn from PyImageSearch. The fire dataset and non-fire datasets are located in seperate directories within the same folder.

### Fire Dataset
The fire dataset includes various images of forest fires in nature, as well as several images of building and road fires.

### Non-Fire Dataset
The non-fire dataset includes various photographs of nature, as well as various images including colors typically found in fires such as red or orange and several manmade structures.

## Project Structure
The Jupyter Notebook accesses a folder named content, which is the root runtime directory in Google Colabratory. After uploading the datasets to Google Drive, the drive was then mounted to the filespace. The fire and non-fire datasets are located in folders named Fire Dataset and Non-Fire Dataset, respectively.
